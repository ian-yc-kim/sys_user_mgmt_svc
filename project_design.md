- **Database Used:** PostgreSQL
- **Justification:** Adheres to the system constraint of one database per subsystem and leverages PostgreSQL’s robust features for data integrity, scalability, and support for complex queries.

#### Features and Requirements
- **User Signup:** Facilitates new user registrations by collecting essential details and initiating email verification to confirm the user’s email address.
- **User Login:** Authenticates users based on their credentials and issues JWT tokens upon successful login for session management.
- **User Logout:** Terminates user sessions by invalidating JWT tokens, ensuring secure logout processes.
- **Account Termination:** Allows users to initiate account termination, marking accounts as terminated to prevent future logins and comply with user requests.
- **Password Reset:** Enables users to securely reset forgotten passwords by sending reset links to registered email addresses.

#### API Definitions
- **POST /signup:** Registers a new user by accepting user details and initiating email verification.
- **POST /login:** Authenticates a user with email and password, returning a JWT token upon successful login.
- **POST /logout:** Logs out the user by invalidating the current JWT token.
- **POST /terminate:** Initiates account termination, marking the account as terminated.
- **POST /password-reset-request:** Sends a password reset link to the user’s registered email address.
- **POST /password-reset:** Resets the user’s password based on the provided reset token.

#### Data Model
- **User:** Contains fields such as `id` (UUID), `email` (unique), `full_name`, `country`, `state_province`, `password_hash`, `is_active` (boolean), and `is_terminated` (boolean).
- **Token:** (Optional) Stores invalidated JWT tokens if token blacklisting is implemented to manage logout operations.

#### Module Structure
- **Authentication Module:** Manages user authentication processes, including login, logout, and JWT token issuance.
- **User Management Module:** Handles user registration, account termination, and password reset functionalities.
- **Email Service Module:** Manages sending verification and password reset emails through the integrated SMTP server.
- **Database Module:** Encapsulates all database interactions using SqlAlchemy, including session management and query execution.

- **Asynchronous Operations:** Utilizes asynchronous tasks for email sending and other I/O-bound operations to improve response times and overall system performance.

## 4. Subsystem Interactions
The **user-management-service** interacts with other subsystems primarily through secure API calls, leveraging JWT tokens for authentication. For instance, when a user logs in, the **user-management-service** issues a JWT token that other subsystems use to authenticate requests. Additionally, the **user-management-service** may interact with logging or auditing subsystems to record user activities and ensure compliance.

## 5. Data Management Strategy
- **Data Isolation:** User data is strictly contained within the **user-management-service** PostgreSQL database, ensuring isolation and preventing unauthorized access from other subsystems.
- **Data Sharing:** Other subsystems access user data exclusively via secure APIs provided by the **user-management-service**, utilizing JWT tokens for authentication and authorization.
- **Data Consistency:** Ensures transactional integrity within the **user-management-service** by implementing ACID-compliant transactions, maintaining consistent user states across all operations.

## 6. Global Security Strategy
