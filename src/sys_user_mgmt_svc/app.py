"""
Application initialization module.

This module provides the `create_app` function, which initializes and configures the application.

Note:
- Implement the application initialization logic within the `create_app` function.
- Set up dependencies such as databases, caches, and external services.
- Configure components like middleware, routes, and error handlers as needed.
- Ensure that the returned `app` object has a `run()` method to start the application.
